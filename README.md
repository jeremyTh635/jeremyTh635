### Hello. My nameâ€™s Jeremy Thorpe and Iâ€™ve just finished a boot camp in software engineering with Hyperion.dev.

This repository features several projects I completed during the course, all of them written in Python.

### About me

I am new to software development having had a previous career in teaching, mostly outside the UK of which I am a citizen. During that time, I worked in Spain, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Saudi Arabia and most recently Oman before returning to the UK in 2020. I have travelled to quite a few other countries besides these.

In addition to travelling, I am also keen on photography and in fact have a website which I built last year using Adobe Portfolio and which can be viewed at <https://jeremythorpe.photography/>. My plan is to recreate the site completely by coding it myself from scratch. The code will be shared here.

Currently, I am looking for work in the areas of software development or software engineering. In the meantime, I am doing my best to expand my knowledge of coding, not only in Python but also in other languages as well.
