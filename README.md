### Hello. My nameâ€™s Jeremy Thorpe and Iâ€™ve just finished a boot camp in software engineering with Hyperion.dev.

### About me

I am new to software development having had a previous career in teaching, mostly outside the UK which is my home country. During that time, I worked in Spain, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, Saudi Arabia and most recently Oman before returning to the UK in 2020. I have travelled to quite a few other countries besides these.

In addition to travelling, I am also keen on photography and in fact have a website which I built last year using Adobe Portfolio and which can be viewed at **<https://jeremythorpe.photography/>**. My plan for the next few weeks is to recreate the site completely by coding it myself from scratch. The code will be shared here.

Currently, I am looking for work in the areas of software development or software engineering. In the meantime, I am doing my best to expand my knowledge of coding, not only in Python but also in other languages as well.

I have shared some of the work I did on my recent course here. The samples of my code can be viewed in the repository named **finalCapstone**. I would be grateful for any comments or suggestions for improvement.
